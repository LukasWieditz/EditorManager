External fonts are fonts, that are neither already on your clients device nor hosted on your own server. They are resources, that are located somewhere else on the web. The main advantages of using these fonts are the large choice of available fonts from different hosters, the bandwidth you save by not having to provide them to the users yourself and the likelyhood of those fonts already being in the cache of your users from a different website they visited before.
