This option controls the length of time for which the proxy logs will be maintained after the last request made to an audio or a video. If an entry is not requested for this amount of time, its data (including first request time and total accesses) will be removed. Proxy logs will never be removed unless the audio or video data has been removed (Audio/video cache lifetime). Use 0 to disable pruning of the logs.
