Serverside fonts are hosted directly from your server. You will have to manually upload these fonts to the <code class="bbCodeInline">data/fonts/</code>-directory inside your XenForo installation. Supported file types are <code class="bbCodeInline">woff2, woff, ttf, otf, eot & svg</code>. It is recommended, to provide a <code class="bbCodeInline">woff2</code> file. Your uploaded files will be matched into a set by the system and will be listed below. Ensure, that they all share the same name in order to have them listed in a single group. You will have to resave the font, if you decide to upload additional file types later on. The filename will match the font family.
