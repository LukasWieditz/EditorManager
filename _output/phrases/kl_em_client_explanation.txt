Clientside fonts are fonts, that are already available on your users devices. The advantage is clearly, that they do not need to be downloaded to the device, when the page is loaded. However, this brings a severe disadvantage: If a user does not already have the font, it cannot be rendered for him. If none of the fonts in the font stack is available to him, his system will use the default font instead. It is recommended to carefully consider the font collection before chosing this option.
